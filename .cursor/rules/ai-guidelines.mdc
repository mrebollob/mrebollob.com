# AI Coding Guidelines

## Project understanding
- Before writing or modifying any code, run and analyze `git ls-files`.
- Understand the project structure, modules, and dependencies first.
- If required context is missing, stop and ask for clarification.

## Hard constraints
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code.
- Do NOT introduce new dependencies without explicit approval.
- Do NOT change or remove public APIs unless explicitly requested.
- Avoid broad or global changes not required by the task.

## Working process
- Propose a short plan before writing code when changes are non-trivial.
- Clearly state which files will be modified and why.
- If a solution requires significant architectural changes, stop and ask first.

## Output quality
- Produce production-quality code only.
- Avoid unnecessary TODOs or placeholders.
- Consider edge cases and failure scenarios.

## Android / Compose specific
- Follow the existing architecture and patterns in the project.
- Optimize for Compose recomposition.
- Use `remember`, `derivedStateOf`, and state hoisting appropriately.
- Keep business logic out of Composables when applicable.

## Style and consistency
- Match existing naming conventions and code style.
- Keep changes minimal and incremental.
